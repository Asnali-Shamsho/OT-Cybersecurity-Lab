# OT-Cybersecurity & Process Automation Lab
A comprehensive hands-on portfolio combining **Process Automation** and **Operational Technology (OT) Cybersecurity** practices.  
These labs demonstrate secure design, configuration, and protection of industrial systems including **Foxboro DCS**, **HMI design**, **network hardening**, and **data protection** strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To bridge the gap between automation engineering and cybersecurity by implementing secure architectures and protection mechanisms within industrial control environments.

## 🔧 Lab Projects Overview

### 1. ⚙️ Foxboro DCS Logic Design
- Developed control logic using Foxboro DCS to simulate process automation control loops.  
- Configured I/O modules and control blocks to represent real-world field instrumentation.  
- Focused on best practices for secure configuration and access control within the DCS.

### 2. 🖥️ HMI Design and Configuration
- Designed intuitive Human-Machine Interfaces for plant visualization and operator control.  
- Implemented role-based access and secure communication to backend controllers.  
- Applied cybersecurity concepts to minimize attack surfaces at the visualization layer.

### 3. 🌐 Industrial Network Configuration
- Designed segmented **IT–DMZ–OT** architecture following **ISA/IEC 62443** guidelines.  
- Configured VLANs, routing, and firewall policies for secure communication.  
- Implemented monitoring to detect unauthorized access attempts in the OT network.

### 4. 🛡️ Endpoint Protection (Trellix ENS + ePO)
- Deployed **Trellix Endpoint Security** on OT workstations.  
- Configured **Threat Prevention**, **Firewall**, and **Device Control** policies.  
- Integrated systems with **Trellix ePO** for centralized monitoring and incident response.

### 5. 🧩 WSUS Patch Management
- Established secure patch deployment using **Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)** across IT–DMZ–OT layers.  
- Configured synchronization rules and testing schedules for critical OT systems.  
- Demonstrated patch verification, rollback, and reporting procedures.

### 6. 💾 Data Backup & Restoration (Veritas)
- Installed and configured **Veritas Backup Exec** for data protection within OT environments.  
- Created backup jobs for DCS configurations, engineering workstations, and servers.  
- Tested restoration procedures to validate disaster recovery readiness.
